## About

At ZENTA, we are on a mission to transform the field of diagnostic imaging by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence. Our cutting-edge AI chatbot co-pilot system, AIstronaut, serves as a second pair of eyes for radiologists, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in the analysis of medical images, including CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans.

With AIstronaut's sophisticated linguistic AI orchestrator, we have created a groundbreaking solution that seamlessly integrates multiple image-analysis AI tools, treating them as plugins. This enables radiologists to identify, segment, and track potential anomalies with unparalleled precision, reducing the risk of human error and improving diagnostic outcomes.
